# Installation

This tutorial requires that you have access to a "terminal" application with several ssh programs installed. 

If you are using Windows, you will need to install [the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). WSL will have the ssh programs you need by default, so once you've installed WSL you are ready for this tutorial. 

If you are using macOS or Linux, then you should already have a terminal application installed. 

For macOS, this application is called Terminal. To open Terminal, you can either 

* Open Finder, select the Go menu, then select Utilties. In the Utilities folder you should be able to find and open Terminal. 

* Use the Mac "Spotlight" computer search function. Search for 'Terminal' and press `RETURN`. 

More information about how to use the Terminal application in macOS can be found [here](https://www.macworld.com/article/671618/how-to-use-terminal-on-mac.html).

For Linux, you can access the terminal from the application menu or the search bar. For most Debian and Ubuntu based systems, `CTRL + ALT + T` will also open the terminal application.
